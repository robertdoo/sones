And I grew up always thinking that my family is just fine until things rose to the surface when I was 15. My parents  separated, my dad be came unusually violent started drinking and driving at the same time. Then I find out that both my parents had previous marriages and that my dads kids live in the house that was supposed to belong to me and my sisters back in my country. My older sister who was the one that physically abused me is my half sister. And now I'm left angry about why both my parents kept lieing to me and my two younger sisters all our lives. Now I don't want to see my dad, I don't want to see my half sister, and I lost all trust in my mother. Comming from a different country for political reasons was difficult enough. This is the last thing that I didn't want to deal with. Now I'm dealing with anger issues that I have a hard time supressing, I have to learn to release things in healthy ways just so I don't wind up hurting myself after bottling up and exploding. And I'm afraid this will be like that, probably  for the rest of my life. So I really feel those kids now. People keep saying that they are old enough to make decisions and should be given the right to see their mother and I agree with that. But they will be dealing with this all for a VERY LONG TIME.

Do the methane gasses from the well have the ability to collect in our atmosphere or in low lying gaseous clouds?

Of course, I am unsure how the US goverment can implement rules and law on international waters... how would this be handled if the well was owned by PeMEX?  As most people are unaware in 1979 the worst oil disaster in the gulf (even worst than today's BP) was a drilling rig from PEMEX and I cannot find documentation of US legal proceedings or intervention by the US goverment.   \n\nAt that time, the blowout of the Ixtoc I, drilled by the Mexican-run Pemex, which retains the dubious record of causing the world's largest accidental oil spill, dumping an estimated 138 million gallons over nine months. Eventually, Pemex cut off Ixtoc I with two relief wells and a cement seal.  That is the plan currently being exercised by BP at the same time as all the other experimental procedures.  That process of relief wells are the only method 100% proven to kill the well, and the method recorded as a back up plan by most (if not all) of the permits approved for deep sea drilling in the GoM.  Perhaps, we have forgotten the past?  I guess 20 years do that...Although we have progress a lot because the first blowout relief well took 9 month to drill, while BP is in track to reach 14,000ft of deep (well depth) only 4,200ft from interception depth.

Moving the location will allow them to PROPERLY REPAIR this pipe. I have a design that was sent to BP that will allow for this item to be permenently welded on after it has been ... See Moreattached. They can not weld anything until the oil has been moved. Welding the coupling in place will give them the strength they need. The clipping part of the coupling shown in the video is for a temporary redirection of the oil only. If the main break is under the ground there is no reason they can not remove the dirt surrounding the pipe to allow for a PROFFESIONAL REPAIR. I have been in construction for over 20 years and have used this method, on a much smaller scale, to repair similar blow outs of pipes. The process works as shown in the video. \n\nIf you have any questions about these videos I may be reached at (954) 242-4782, (561) 346-5120 or KKLAW11@aol.com\n\nThank You,\nKenny Lawrence\n","created_time":"2010-05-29T14:03:30+0000"},{"id":"5550296508_130040327012729_738468","from":{"name":"Verena Maser","id":"634988636"},"message":"Oh wow.

Nature provides us with a resource that helps handle any oil or chemical spills, on contact; naturally without any side effects  \u2026\n\n\u2026 a resource that biodegrades oil, breaking it down to its natural components (H2O, CO2 and fatty acids), none of which are toxic or hazardous to the environment;\n\n\u2026 a resource that ABsorbs not ADsorbs (like polypropylene, hair, hay, etc.) , therefore will not leach;\n\n\u2026 a resource that rejects water, in its dehydrated form;\n\n\u2026 a resource that does not merely breakdown the molecular structure of oil to have it sink to the bottom of the ocean floor (like surfactants do);\n\n\u2026 a resource that is naturally renewable and becomes stronger with each harvest;\n\nWe have not just come out of the woodwork due to this crisis.  In June 2000, when \u201cgreen\u201d was not the talk of the town, my husband and I started a business with such a product.  We have focused a lot of time and energy on educating people (including children in schools) on alternative ways to handle oil and chemical spills, by using this product.  We started this business because of an awareness that we need to make some changes with the environment.  It is time for us to take more responsibility for our actions, on all levels, including with Mother Earth and how we treat her.  Some part of humanity knows this, hence the large movement towards \u201cgreen\u201d.  \n\nWe are now at a point where Mother Earth is clearly making a cry for help and I have a strong hearts desire that I can no longer ignore.  To stand up and help, and not play small.  Look at what happened with the Exxon Valdez.  Here we are over 21 years later, and we are still being impacted by that spill, in so many ways.  We can not afford to allow this to happen.  Especially in the fragile state that Mother Earth is now in.  What I need is a voice, a voice from someone who is out there in the media, and will be heard.  Someone with connections that can reach the authorities, and help create awareness so that they can no longer ignore this solution.   That is what I am reaching out for.\n\nYou can visit our website at www.Synergy-Environmental.com, or http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kJY8nvpdzn0&NR=1 and get a better idea of the potential here.  As you will find there, we have obtained approval from the EPA and many other government agencies on the use of this product.  You can also contact Rita Graham with DERM (Department of Environmental Resource Management for Miami \u2013Dade County, Florida) 305-297-2583.  DERM has been using this product for years in similar wetland situations and much more.  \n\nNot one single solution is going to solve this crisis.  We have to all pull together to resolve this, otherwise we will be paying a very high price.\n\nPlease, if you hear my heart\u2019s call, contact me immediately, so that we can move forward, taking one step at a time, to make a HUGE difference, not only to the environment, but all those families whose livelihood will be affected by this spill, not to mention so many people\u2019s health.   It is time, NOW, we can not afford to wait and ponder this situation.\n\nIn service,\nAna Mariza McGroarty\nSynergy Environmental, Inc.\n954-309-3656\n434-284-1733\n","created_time":"2010-05-29T15:01:57+0000"},{"id":"5550296508_130211476995844_766857","message":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/board.php?uid=5550296508#!\/topic.php?uid=5550296508&topic=24424","created_time":"2010-05-29T16:25:54+0000"},{"id":"5550296508_130211476995844_770692","from":{"name":"Justin Case","id":"100001124891761"},"message":"How was their a pause button????
