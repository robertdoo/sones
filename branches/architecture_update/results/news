And I grew up always thinking that my family is just fine until things rose to the surface when I was 15. My parents  separated, my dad be came unusually violent started drinking and driving at the same time. Then I find out that both my parents had previous marriages and that my dads kids live in the house that was supposed to belong to me and my sisters back in my country. My older sister who was the one that physically abused me is my half sister. And now I'm left angry about why both my parents kept lieing to me and my two younger sisters all our lives. Now I don't want to see my dad, I don't want to see my half sister, and I lost all trust in my mother. Comming from a different country for political reasons was difficult enough. This is the last thing that I didn't want to deal with. Now I'm dealing with anger issues that I have a hard time supressing, I have to learn to release things in healthy ways just so I don't wind up hurting myself after bottling up and exploding. And I'm afraid this will be like that, probably  for the rest of my life. So I really feel those kids now. People keep saying that they are old enough to make decisions and should be given the right to see their mother and I agree with that. But they will be dealing with this all for a VERY LONG TIME. Well past therapy too. There's some things that therapy can't mend.","created_time":"2010-06-03T20:20:50+0000"},{"id":"5550296508_127224307304973_689974","from":{"name":"Anyite Geraldo","id":"100000076579674"},"message":"Amaziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing !!!","created_time":"2010-06-03T20:21:48+0000"},{"id":"5550296508_127224307304973_689979","from":{"name":"Jessica Lowe","id":"744597418"},"message":"OMG!
