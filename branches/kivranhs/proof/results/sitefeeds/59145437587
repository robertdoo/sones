Some people may just find this world too harsh. We always tend to call them lunatics etc, but there is obviously something inherently wrong here. What drove this man over the edge?  Why couldnt anyone have helped him before he snapped?  It's when there is a break down in the social structure, families and communities where people feel so isolated to act out their deepest emotions. Im not condoning this, but we are all to blame in some way when someone has to resort to this evil. Look around you and get to know that neighbour of yours, speak to the shopkeeper, speak to that woman on the bus. Make eye contact with people - we are too busy avoiding people and getting on with our own lives. We are here for mankind, so do you bit.","created_time":"2010-06-02T16:31:23+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_124611747569299_646833","from":{"name":"Haider Rizvi","id":"100000416367882"},"message":" Why must these people make more victims can they not just shoot themselves as they dont value human life anyway","created_time":"2010-06-02T16:57:25+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_124611747569299_646909","from":{"name":"Alexsander Dukakis","id":"100001152327079"},"message":"ATAT\u00dcRK:PEACE at home PEACE in the world.\n","created_time":"2010-06-02T17:06:23+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_124611747569299_647406","from":{"name":"Jari Saarinen","id":"1632186156"},"message":"My deepest concolences to the families and friends of the victims..and to everyone in the UK :( \nThis has been a horrible tragedy :(\nI sincerly hope that those, who have been injured, will make a full and speedy recovery!\nGun related violence is a ugly thing.

Suspects found to be carrying multiple weapons, cash\n\nRon Ben-Yishai\nPublished: \t06.01.10, 21:20 \/ Israel News\n\nVIDEO - The ongoing interrogation of passengers who were aboard the Marmara \u2013 the Gaza aid flotilla's flagship \u2013 revealed that the majority of those who attacked the Israeli Naval Commandos boarding the ship have direct and indirect Global Jihad ties.\n\nIsrael's investigation has revealed some 100 people infiltrated the peace and humanitarian aid activists making their way to Gaza, with the explicit design to attack Israeli soldiers using cold arms.\n\n Some among that group are believed to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly al-Qaeda.\n\nThe majority of suspects are Turks, but some are Yemenites and Indonesian. One Yemenite Islamist was photographed with a dagger in his belt prior to the raid.\n\nThe suspects are not cooperating with investigators. Most of them have no identification papers, and Israeli authorities are still trying to ascertain their identity.\n\nNevertheless, it is clear that the majority were recruited by the same IHH handler who organized the flotilla.\n\n\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd: \u05d3\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d4\"\u05dc\nNavy fighters attacked by passengers (Video: IDF Spokesperson's Office)\n\nIHH is a Turkish humanitarian relief fund with a radical Islamic anti-Western orientation.\n\nSome of the suspects were found to be carrying large sums of money. Others had Kevlar vests and gas masks; and all were found to be carrying weapons such as knives, metal clubs and slingshots.\n\nSeveral of the suspected were wounded by IDF fire.\n\nInvestigators have already concluded that this was the group that planned the violent resistance, which centered on the Marmara's top deck.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israel Navy has launched its own inquiry into the raid. Senior officers told yet events probably went awry when the commandos lost the element of surprise \u2013 especially in regards to the people waiting on the top deck.\n","created_time":"2010-06-01T20:29:04+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_121342701236818_583843","from":{"name":"Keith Pine","id":"1427640747"},"message":"Netanyahu is a Zionist gangster.He doesn't give a shit!","created_time":"2010-06-01T20:31:08+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_121342701236818_584293","from":{"name":"Hdyt Bytk","id":"1587474008"},"message":"Israel is defending  itself with in a lie video.","created_time":"2010-06-01T22:02:07+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_121342701236818_584310","from":{"name":"Hdyt Bytk","id":"1587474008"},"message":" Israel is trying to darken the eyes of the world with censored video .\n","created_time":"2010-06-01T22:05:22+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_121342701236818_584331","from":{"name":"Hdyt Bytk","id":"1587474008"},"message":"Do not believe the lies video","created_time":"2010-06-01T22:11:14+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_121342701236818_584414","from":{"name":"Pawe\u0142 S.

This occupation has been the biggest single factor as it pertains to our insane relationship we have with the Arab World.

Why does the BBC not provide any coverage for such an important international event as the \"Free Gaza\" flotilla of 9 boats and 750 people, including European Parliament members, a retired US colonel and humanitarian leaders from around the world that is happening right now?\n\nhttp:\/\/sabbah.biz\/mt\/archives\/2010\/05\/28\/why-is-israel-afraid-of-a-few-boats\/\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/gazafriends#p\/a\/367C83DE51DE116E\/0\/HBHvYDrg3PY\n\nhttp:\/\/witnessgaza.com\/\n\nThese people's lives are in danger, Israel has promised to intercept and we need to support this action immediately in order to end Israel's blockade of Gaza. You don't need to be against Jews or even against the Israeli people to see that that the government of Israel is committing international crimes. The blockade needs to be stopped for Israel's sake as well. The government is trying to hide the theft of an enormous natural gas reserve by claiming that all 1.5 million Gazans are terrorists and must all be collectively punished. Imagine if some other country hated what the American or British government was doing and decided to punish all Americans or Brits for the wrongdoing of their respective governments. It would make no sense and neither does this blockade. Free Gaza in order to free Israel from tyrannical rule by a bunch of war criminals!!!","created_time":"2010-05-29T15:12:12+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_125374700817149_643632","from":{"name":"Tamir Halperin","id":"760375605"},"message":"Stop listening to lies about all Gazans being terrorists.

If you actually read the accounts on how he jet-skied, fell into the seas twice and then hauled himself up onto the ship, it is just purely bizarre. What was he thinking doing such a thing on high seas? 2 conflicting versions of the story emerge as to his motives: a) he is serving papers for the ramming of Ady Gil; b) effecting a citizens' arrest for attempted murder. And was he serious in effecting a citizen's arrest when he is outnumbered on the Shona Maru? I believe now is the time to postulate - what would be the most realistic outcome if a person, regardless of whatever political view you hold, board onto a foreign vessel in Intl waters in such a manner? \n\nApart from that, his wife had had enough of all these and they're now separated. He's an eco-warrior who seems to have forgotten about his remortgaged homes and his responsibility to bring home the bacon for the past couple of years when he has a wife and two growing kids to feed.\n\nWhen u risk your life, family, financial security, kids and everything to chase after whale hunters, is it worth it? Yes and no. But, in my opinion, ultimately no. \n\nI dont understand the constant undermining of the Japanese Court system on NZ television- as if they are inferior to common law courts, or as if its a kangaroo court or a show-trial. Courts decide matters of law, not politics. True as it may be there is a political undertone in this issue, but, that's not for the Courts. If by law he is guilty, what can be done??? If the courts are partial, biased against foreigners and have no workable system of appealing - then the conviction rate of 90+% can be justifiedly criticised. If not, there is no basis to vilify them. \n\nReference:\nhttp:\/\/www.stuff.co.nz\/sunday-star-times\/features\/3725222\/Home-alone\n\nhttp:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/eloise-gibson\/news\/article.cfm?a_id=366&objectid=10627312&pnum=0","created_time":"2010-05-27T15:36:58+0000"},{"id":"59145437587_120301078009698_554340","from":{"name":"Patrick Farrelly","id":"593562564"},"message":"@ Joseph L Cooke, & you were a policeman?
